## Introduction

Through Chat SDK for flutter, you can efficiently integrate real-time chat into your client app. On the client-side implementation, you can initialize, configure and build the chat with minimal effort. On the server-side, Sendbird ensures reliable infra-management services for your chat within the app. This **readme** provides essential information on the Chat SDKâ€™s structure, supplementary features, and the installation steps. 

### How it works

It is simple to implement chat in your client app with Sendbird Chat SDK for Flutter: a user logs in, sees a list of channels, selects or creates an [open channel](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/flutter/guides/open-channel) or a [group channel](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/flutter/guides/group-channel), and, through the use of the [channel event handler](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/v3/flutter/guides/event-handler), sends messages to the channel, while also receiving them from other users within the channel.
